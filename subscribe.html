<p>Dear Fellow Real Estate Agent:</p>

<p>We understand that you may be working at a real estate brokerage or on a traditional team as part of someone else’s personal brand. Perhaps you’re just getting started in your career, but feel as if your current path isn’t leading you to the success you deserve. Or maybe you’ve got the skills and drive to do well in the business, but have found that <strong>“good enough” is not always good enough.</strong> </p>

<p>The simple truth is that even the most talented individuals can’t thrive if they’re struggling against an inadequate work environment, and proper training is a rare thing in our business.</p>

<p>Working in these environments can be discouraging. <strong>You fall in line only to find that you’re not moving forward—you’re just spinning your wheels.</strong> Agents at most brokerages receive very little income, support, or training. The truth is that 87% of agents will fail within their first five years in the industry. They give their all only to eventually leave the business and land themselves in a 9-to-5 job where they’re barely scraping by. </p>

<p>Many agents who do remain in the industry are not much better off. 50% of all MLS members sell just two homes a year on average. </p>

<p>The majority of agents dream of going above and beyond this level. They devote a lot of energy into setting goals, but very little energy into achieving them. A select few, however, will take charge of their situation and strive toward success. <strong>If this sounds like you, we’ve got good news.</strong> </p>

<p>First, allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Coldwell Banker The Professional Group, and we have helped many agents just like you fulfill their potential. With 40, 28, and 25 years of experience in the industry, respectively, our team leaders Jerry, Kathy, and Kathleen are more than equipped to help new agents evolve into top producers. We have trained thousands of agents, and we look forward to training you, too.</p>

<p><strong>Agents who join us gain instant access to a number of invaluable resources, such as:</strong>
<ul class="indent">
<li>Mentoring</li>
<li>Accountability</li>
<li>One-on-one training</li>
<li>Leads</li>
<li>Proven systems </li>
<li>And much more!</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The choice is yours. You could try your luck at a less successful brokerage or even leave the business to pursue a 9-to-5 job, or you can join us, plug into our systems, and start seeing the success you deserve. <strong>Why pass up the potential to earn millions when the option is right in front of you?</strong> </p>

<p>Coldwell Banker The Professional Group is unlike any other. When you join us, your path to success starts right away. We’ll send you through our intensive 180-day onboarding system, immerse you into our company culture, and get you involved in our Six-Module training program—which covers information about purchase contracts, prospecting, marketing and lead generation, the buying process, the selling process, negotiation techniques, and our full-feature CRM: Commissions Inc. </p>

<p>Better yet, <strong>agents with Coldwell Banker The Professional Group don’t just have a successful professional life—they also have the freedom and income to enjoy a fruitful personal life, as well.</strong> </p>

<p>But don’t just take our word for it. In order to truly grasp what joining us could do for you, we’d like you to consider the experience of one of our current agents. Before this agent came to us, she had spent seven months trying (and failing) to thrive at a different local brokerage. Recognizing the fact that things needed to change, she left that brokerage and came to us, instead. She followed our intense one-on-one training system and, as a result, earned $82,000 in commission within her first year. </p>

<p><strong>This agent’s success story is incredible, but now it’s time for you to write your own.</strong> </p>

<p>If you follow our program, we guarantee you’ll be successful. Through our weekly training meetings and dedication to personal guidance, we take agents and turn them into business professionals. We’re offering you training, very competitive compensation, cutting-edge technology, a great work/life balance, and, above all, success. When you apply with us, you are taking advantage of the opportunity to truly fulfill your potential. </p>

<p>We’re looking forward to talking to you soon!</p>
