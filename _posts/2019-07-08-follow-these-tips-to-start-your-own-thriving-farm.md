Farming has helped me tremendously as a real estate agent, and if you’re ready to get started building your own farm, here are the steps you need to take.&nbsp;

First, **pick an area of single-family homes/townhomes/condos that you like and find out how many homeowners in this area you want to farm.** I myself started with 500, and this is a number that gives you a good chance of getting some business. If you do less than that, your chances get slimmer.

After that, talk to the title company to assist you in gathering the addresses of all the homeowners. They’ll then put these into a formatted email, which will help you with your marketing. Your marketing can involve sending postcards, newsletters, or free emails.&nbsp;

Lastly, **make sure you have a budget in place** that allows you to market to these homeowners consistently each month instead of, say, once every four months. They won’t remember you if you’re not consistent.&nbsp;

If you have any more questions about farming, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
